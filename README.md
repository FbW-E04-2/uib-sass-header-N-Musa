# UIB-SASS-Header

Let's get familiar with  SCSS/SASS by creating this header section. You can reference your notes/pdf/links from our lecture this morning. 

This might be a good start: [Sass Basics guide. ](https://sass-lang.com/guide)

Try to use the functionality that SASS offers: 
- Partials. Take advantage of this to organize and split up your SCSS
- SASS variables. Perhaps keep these all in one partial to be able and easily change your site theme. 
- Nesting
- Extends
- Mixins
- And whatever other functionalities of SASS you'd like to explore.
